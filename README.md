# iTop module: Chat integration with tawk.to

## About

[tawk.to](https://www.tawk.to/) is a free, hosted, third-party, live support chat that can be easily integrated within iTop to offer a new contact channel. It's a perfect way to enable live chat in iTop with a minimal effort/investment.
It also allows the tawk.to support agent to create a ticket in iTop from thetawk.to dashboard.

For more information about this module have a look at the corresponding [extension documentation](https://store.itophub.io/en_US/products/combodo-tawk-integration).


## Download

Release packages can be found on the [iTop Hub Store](https://store.itophub.io/en_US/taxons/all-extensions). This is the best way to get a
running package as those contains all the needed modules and stable code.

When downloading directly from GitHub (by cloning or downloading as zip) you will get potentially unstable code, and you will miss
additional modules.
